# JWPubLib

This is a collection of *.jwpub* archives that can be added to the **JW Library** app[^1] by simply downloading the "Latest release" of the one you want and tapping/double-clicking the downloaded file. It will appear in the "Guidelines" category (Library/DOWNLOADED).

These archives are a collection of reference works that are in the public domain, adapted for use with JW Library.

## Before you ask...

If you are looking for the **production code/methods**, that *cannot* be shared. If you want to roll your own, what you need is "out there", but I won't point you at it either. Thanks for understanding and for not insisting.
