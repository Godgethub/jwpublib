# JWPubLib

This is a collection of **Public Domain** reference works packaged as *.jwpub* archives that can be added to the **JW Library** app[^1] by simply downloading the "Latest release" and tapping/double-clicking the downloaded file. It will appear in the "Guidelines" category (Library/DOWNLOADED).

### Before you ask...

If you are looking for the **production code/methods**, that *cannot* be shared. The same goes for the source material. Thanks for understanding and for not insisting.
